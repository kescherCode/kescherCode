## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It seems you have stumbled upon my profile, so let me tell you about myself.

I am currently a software engineer and sysadmin by choice. I am currently employed and am not looking for jobs.
Currently, most of my own repositories aren't all interesting, and consist of either small utilities or pointless software - however, feel free to take a look at my contributions on other repositories.

Other than the software development I do in public, I host a few services for others to use and/or enjoy, some of which are listed at [kescher.at](https://www.kescher.at/).

I would highly appreciate donations for keeping my services running, hosting more services and continuing to contribute to free and open-source software.
I'd rather have you donate to those that would need a donation much more than I would, but if you feel generous anyway, I'd at the very least appreciate it!
