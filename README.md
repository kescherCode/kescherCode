## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software engineer who is also dabbling in sysadmin stuff.
I host a few services for others to use and/or enjoy, some of which are listed at [kescher.at](https://www.kescher.at/).
And I want to get more into developing free and open-source software. I have contributed to a few projects already.

I would highly appreciate donations for keeping my services running, hosting more services and developing free and open-source software.
Of course, I don't expect anyone to actually do so, but if you feel generous, I'd highly appreciate it!
