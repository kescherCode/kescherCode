## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It seems you have stumbled upon my profile, so let me tell you about myself.

I am a self-employed voice actor (contact me via my website! if you want voice work done), but I am also employed as a software engineer and sysadmin (not looking for any jobs in this avenue).
Currently, most of my own repositories aren't all interesting, and consist of either small utilities or pointless software - however, feel free to take a look at my contributions on other repositories, which are far more interesting.

Other than the software development I do in public, I host a few services for others to use and/or enjoy, some of which are listed at [kescher.at](https://www.kescher.at/).

I would highly appreciate donations for keeping my services running, hosting more services and continuing to contribute to free and open-source software.
I'd rather have you donate to those that would need a donation much more than I would, but if you feel generous anyway, I won't take away the possibility :D
